CSS pseudo-elements are a powerful feature that allows you to style specific parts of selected elements without the need for additional JavaScript code. While many developers are familiar with commonly used pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`, there are several others that often go unnoticed or underutilized. In this article, we will explore 9 lesser-known CSS pseudo-elements that can enhance your styling capabilities. Let's dive in!

1\. The `::selection` Pseudo-Element
====================================

The `::selection` pseudo-element targets the portion of the text that a user has selected. It provides a way to apply styles to the selected text and customize its appearance. Here's an example:

::selection {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: red;
}

In the above code, when a user selects text on the page, it will be highlighted with a yellow background and red text color.

2\. The `::first-letter` Pseudo-Element
=======================================

The `::first-letter` pseudo-element allows you to style the first letter of a block-level element. It comes in handy when you want to apply special formatting to the initial character of a paragraph or heading. Here's an example:

p::first-letter {
  font-size: 2em;
  color: red;
}

In the above code snippet, the first letter of every paragraph will be displayed in larger font size and have a red color.

3\. The `::first-line` Pseudo-Element
=====================================

Similar to `::first-letter`, the `::first-line` pseudo-element targets the first line of a text or block-level element. You can apply specific styles to the initial line of a paragraph or a headline using this pseudo-element. Here's an example:

p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

In the above code, the first line of every paragraph will be displayed in bold and underlined.

4\. The `::marker` Pseudo-Element
=================================

The `::marker` pseudo-element targets the marker of a list item, such as the bullet point in an unordered list or the number in an ordered list. With this pseudo-element, you can customize the appearance of the markers. Here's an example:

li::marker {
  color: blue;
  font-weight: bold;
}

5\. The `::placeholder` Pseudo-Element
======================================

The `::placeholder` pseudo-element allows you to style the placeholder text in input fields and text areas. By applying custom styles to the placeholder, you can enhance the user experience and align it with your overall design. Here's an example:

input::placeholder {
  color: #999;
  font-style: italic;
}

In the above code, the placeholder text in input fields will be displayed in a light gray color with an italic font style.

6\. The `::cue` Pseudo-Element
==============================

The `::cue` pseudo-element targets the cue text of an `<audio>` or `<video>` element. Cue text is typically used for captions or subtitles in multimedia content. With this pseudo-element, you can apply styles specifically to the cue text. Here's an example:

video::cue {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}

In the above code, the cue text in a video element will have white text color and a black background.

7\. The `::grammar-error` and `::spelling-error` Pseudo-Elements
================================================================

The `::grammar-error` and `::spelling-error` pseudo-elements allow you to style portions of text marked as grammar or spelling errors, respectively. These pseudo-elements are useful for providing visual cues to users when there are errors in the content. Here's an example:

p::grammar-error {
  text-decoration: line-through;
  color: red;
}

p::spelling-error {
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: blue;
}

In the above code, grammar errors in a paragraph will be displayed with a line-through text decoration and red color, while spelling errors will have an underline and blue color.

8\. The `::backdrop` Pseudo-Element
===================================

The `::backdrop` pseudo-element is used in conjunction with the Fullscreen API to customize the backdrop behind an element in full-screen mode. It allows you to change the default black backdrop to a custom color or style. Here's an example:

video::backdrop {
  background-color: gray;
}

In the above code, when a video element is in full-screen mode, the backdrop behind it will have a gray background color.

9\. The `::page` Pseudo-Element
===============================

The `::page` pseudo-element targets specific pages when printing a document. It allows you to apply styles to individual pages, such as adding headers or footers. Here's an example:

@page :first {
  margin-top: 50px;
  margin-bottom: 50px;
  header: "First Page";
}
@page :nth-child(2) {
  margin-top: 50px;
  margin-bottom: 50px;
  header: "Second Page";
}

In the above code, the first page of a printed document will have a top margin of 50 pixels, a bottom margin of 50 pixels, and a header displaying “First Page”. The second page will have similar styles but with a different header.

Conclusion
==========

CSS pseudo-elements offer a wide range of possibilities for styling specific parts of elements and enhancing the visual appeal of your web pages. You can achieve impressive styling effects without the need for excessive JavaScript code.

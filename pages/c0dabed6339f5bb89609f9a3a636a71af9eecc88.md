**Smart summary:**

This 9-step sleep routine can help improve sleep quality and reduce the risk of depression, weight gain, and heart disease. It includes getting 7-9 hours of sleep, building a sleep rhythm, getting morning sunlight, exercising in the morning, controlling caffeine intake, catching the evening sun, setting dark mode, expecting the spike, and keeping cool.

I used to wake up tired every morning.

This 9-step sleep routine saved my life (Based on science):

  

1 - Get Your Hours In
---------------------

I aim for 7-9 hours of sleep every night.

Studies show that less than 7 hours a night leads to:

1\. Depression

2\. Weight gain

3\. Heart disease

Instead of obsessing about an exact amount, experiment & see where between 7-9 hours has you feeling your best.

  

2 - Build a Sleep Rhythm
------------------------

Sleep & wake up at the same time every day.

This allows adenosine (the chemical that makes you feel sleepy) to make you feel awake & sleepy at the right times.

How to build a rhythm:

1\. Set an alarm

2\. Socialise earlier

3\. Don't sleep in on weekends

  

3 - Start with Sunlight.
------------------------

Another system that makes you feel awake & sleepy is your internal clock.

Morning sunlight triggers this internal clock to make you feel awake in the morning & sleepy 12-14 hours after exposure.

Aim for 10-30 minutes of sunlight every morning.

  

4 - Morning Exercise.
---------------------

Exercise releases chemicals called endorphins which make you feel awake.

Exercising in the morning can also trigger your body to anticipate it & make you feel even more awake.

Any type of exercise works:

1\. Walking

2\. Running

3\. Lifting weights

  

5 - Caffeine Control.
---------------------

Caffeine blocks the sleepy chemical (Adenosine) receptors that make you feel tired.

It can take 5-6 hours for just 50% of caffeine to leave your system & even longer to be completely gone.

Try to stop drinking caffeine 8-12 hours before your bedtime.

  

6 - Catch The Evening Sun.
--------------------------

Since the sunlight is dim in the evening, getting in direct sunlight tells your internal clock that it’s almost time to go to bed.

Do this every day to help you build your sleep rhythm.

  

7 -Set Dark Mode.
-----------------

Bright lights at night mimic sunlight & will trigger your body to think it’s time to feel awake.

A few ways I avoid these bright lights are:

1\. Using lowlights

2\. Using my Kindle instead of phone

3\. Avoiding computer use after 10 pm

  

8 - Expect the Spike.
---------------------

You naturally have a spike in wakefulness 1 hour before your bedtime.

Instead of getting stressed when this happens, remember it will fade & continue on with your routine.

I’ve found reading a book helps me stay relaxed through this.

  

9 - Keep your Cool.
-------------------

Your body temperature needs to drop by 1-3 degrees in order to fall & stay asleep.

If you have air conditioning, set it between 16-19 degrees at night.

If not, open a window or pick up a cheap fan.

The 9-step sleep routine that saved my life:

  

1\. Get Your Hours In

2\. Build a Sleep Rhythm

3\. Start with Sunlight

4\. Morning Exercise

5\. Caffeine Control

6\. Catch the Evening Sun

7\. Set Dark Mode

8\. Expect the Spike

9\. Keep your Cool

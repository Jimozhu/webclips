"ChatGPT can pick stocks better then top fund managers" - CNN  
  
So we gave it $50,000 of our own money to manage and are sharing the results here  
  
The Fund officially went live today and it‚Äôs already outperforming the $SPY  
  
Here are the set of stocks it pickedüßê [![](https://note-2019-images.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/3e158415.jpe)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FwMVFbnaIAAlGx0.jpg)

For the sake of transparency here is how ChatGPT identified 20 stocks after analyzing a list of over 10,000  
  
Via the ChatGPT API, GPT 3.5 analyzed recent stock news articles and gave each individual stock a sentiment score  
  
This resulted in a graded list of all the stocks

We then took the top 100 and married those stocks with their financial statements by introducing the prompt below  
  
By doing this we ensure ChatGPT understood both the long term financial positions + the short term sentiment of the stocks  
  
Here's what it came up with [![](https://note-2019-images.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/410f7a1a.jpe)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FwMSpmaakAAWdRh.jpg)
